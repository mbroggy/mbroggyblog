I've been procrastinating actually _using_ this, but if I keep messing around with the look and feel, it'll never get content...
<!--more-->

I've got [categories](/categories/) and [tags](/tags/) working, so...time to just start _writing_.

My goal is to write _something_ daily, preferably a few somethings.  There's plenty I should be doing in terms of content for here and, again, it's more for accountability than external consumption... There might be things others find useful (and I'll try and tag/categorize those appropriately) or interesting, if following any of my journeys or thought processes.
