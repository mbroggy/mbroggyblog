## This site
### What is it for?
Accountability, mainly. Sharing, secondarily.

I'm going to try and develop and maintain habits around a number of things I enjoy doing, and part of that is tracking what I'm planning on doing, what I've done, how I did it, whether it succeeded or failed and what I learned from it.

Whether it's coding, brewing, cooking, music, or whatever else I'm up to, I'm going to try and be disciplined about documenting it.

### What runs it?
[Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) is a [static site generator](https://www.reddit.com/r/Frontend/comments/oz4tqu/are_static_site_generators_just_hype_why_not_use/) I'm using, styled via the [PaperMod](https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod) theme. I'm hosting it via [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/) and using GitHub as the code repository for the project. [Read more](/posts/hugo) about why and how I set it up, plus anything I've modified along the way.

## The author
### I'm Michael Broggy. 

I'm a technologist, brewer, cook and budding musician. I grew up in Dublin, Ireland but have been in the US since Junior High. I've lived in NYC, Utah, and now the Philly suburbs. 

I've owned [computers](/posts/computers) since 1982 and taught myself a variety of skills along the way since, especially early on, reference resources weren't readily available. I turned self-taught skills into a career and continue to do a variety of things professionally and as a hobbyist.

[Brewing beer](/posts/brewing) was something I started with a friend a while back; I progressed from extract to all-grain brewing, moving from stovetop to propane and from there to all-in-one systems. I personally prefer continental styles, but tend to be all over the place when it comes time to brew.

[Playing bass](/posts/bass) is something I put effort into over the pandemic; I've owned a bass for many years but never really put the time in to learn it and couldn't stand the lessons offered at the local music store. Learning from [Paul Hutchison](https://paulhutchison.net/) has been a game changer for me.

### I'm Mael Eoin mac Echuid.

In the medieval recreation group [Society for Creative Anachronism](https://www.sca.org/), I'm known as Mael Eoin mac Echuid. I intended to learn to brew, cook and do heraldry but quickly wound up fighting, dancing and holding offices... While I started out in NYC, I now live in the [Barony of Bhakail](https://bhakail.eastkingdom.org/) (a chapter covering much of the greater Philadelphia area), which is part of the [East Kingdom](https://www.eastkingdom.org/). 

I'll write posts and articles related to the SCA; between personal projects, events and other activities, there's a lot going on. If you have any questions about the SCA, [feel free to ask](mailto:mbroggy@gmail.com)!
