After setting this site up for myself, I immediately started wondering about how Hugo might be useful for use in the SCA.  Having a static site versus dynamic could be useful, especially with as often as local group websites get slammed by bots or otherwise abused.

I'll set up another site at [maeleoin.xyz](https://maeleoin.xyz/) to explore possibilities...
