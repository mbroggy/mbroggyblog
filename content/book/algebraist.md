Title: The Algebraist

Author: Iain M. Banks

Notes: Rereading (re-listening); for some reason, it only recently appeared as an option in Audible for me, though we had a CD audiobook of it years ago. An amazing story, it's one that _almost_ seems like it should be set in the Culture universe, but it's not.
