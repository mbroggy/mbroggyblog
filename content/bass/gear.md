Before going into any practicing, etc. I might be doing, here's the gear I have, starting with what I use most often:

<!- more ->

Main setup:
- Ibanez 5-String Bass (signed by Victor Wooten and Steve Bailey)
- Ampeg Rocket Bass RB-108 1x8" 30W Bass Combo Amp
- Zoom B1X Four Bass Multi-Effects Processor
- Boss RC-1 Loop Station
- Boss CS-3 Compression Sustainer
- Boss DR01S Rhythm Partner

Other basses:
- Rogue LX200BF Fretless Series III 4-String Bass
- Hartke 4 String Bass (needs work, not sure of the model)
- Some generic 4-string bass (first bass, action's way too high but I didn't know any better)
- An acoustic bass guitar

Electric guitar:
- SGR C-1 Electric Guitar (when I thought that's what I was going to play)
- Line 6 Spider V 30 MkII 30W 1x8 Guitar Combo Amp

Drums:
- A decent Ludwig drum set (not so much for me to play, but for others if they want to jam)
