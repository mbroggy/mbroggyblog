I love tavern-style events, those events in the SCA which tend to be low-key overall and often relaxed when it comes to food as well. Bear's Tavern was one of the first regular events I was able to make it to, starting out in the SCA, and the memories of being in the kitchen and the event overall really stuck with me.

I started Bhakail's annual Tavern event in 2016 with an eye towards not only recreating the experience but also to provide an event-with-training-wheels for new(er) event stewards and cooks.

At one of the first Bhakail Taverns, we decided to start the day with a cold platter that we could easily provide as people asked for it, rather than worry about tying up the problematic kitchen preparing lunch. It was a hit, so I trotted the idea out again for Tavern 2024.

The kitchen we use at the event is...not great. We encountered issues - as always happens there - but we had plenty of food as people needed. I had been looking forward to the recipes slated for dinner and, sure enough, those were the ones that had a lot of feedback and requests for the recipes.

## Recipes
### Cold platter
* Crudite (carrots, celery)
* Hummus (plain)
* Olives (mixed)
* Cocktail onions
* Za'atar (roasted sesame seeds, sumac, thyme, marjoram, oregano, salt)
* Infused oilve oil (smashed olives and garlic)
* Homemade mustard (mustard seeds, salt, water)
* Sauce verte (parsley, garlic, water, vinegar, salt)
* Stuffed grape leaves
* Cheeses
* Pita wedges

The intention was for folks to dress up the hummus with the flavored oil, za'atar, etc.  The infused oil was a hit, from all accounts.

### Mushroom barley pottage
* 4oz of dried mushrooms (porcini, cremini, shiitake and wood ear)
* 1 package of barley (16oz)
* 1 large white onion, diced
* Quatre epices (cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger, cloves)
* Salt

I thought I had added too much liquid, but the dried mushrooms took in a lot of the water and the pottage thickened nicely.  The spices really added a great angle to this very simple dish.

### Fesenjan
* 1.5 lbs of chicken (I usually use thighs, but we used breast this time)
* 1 large onion, diced
* 1 cup of pomegranate molasses
* 1 cup of walnuts, ground to a paste with water added
* 1/2 tsp of cinnamon
* 1/2 tsp of salt
* Basmati rice

Brown the chicken in some fat.  Add the onions and cook until they're soft.  Add the walnut paste, pomegranate molasses, cinnamon and salt.  Cook until the chicken is done or until you can shred it, if desired.  Taste and add more pomegranate molasses if the balance is not quite right between sweet and tangy.  Serve over basmati rice with pomegranate arils as colorful red jewels on what might otherwise be a very muted dish.
